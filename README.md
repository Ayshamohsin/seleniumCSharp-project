**Selenium C# Project:**   
This project demonstrates the usage of Selenium WebDriver in C# for automating web application testing, including features such as login, appointment creation, and data-driven testing.

**Features:**
1. LogIn Feature
Automates login to a healthcare application.

Validates login with user credentials and ensures successful redirection to the homepage.

2. Appointment Creation
Automates the process of creating appointments in a healthcare system.

Includes test scenarios for success and validation of appointment creation.

3. DataTableDriven Testing
Implements data-driven testing using DataTables.

Tests search functionality by iterating over multiple search keys and validating the results.

4. DataDrivenByExamples
Implements DataDriven testing using Scenario Outline and Examples.

Validates search functionality with different inputs.

5. DataDriven Testing
Passes data from steps to perform DataDriven tests.

Ensures proper validation based on input data.

Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

.NET SDK (Core or Framework, depending on your project setup)

Selenium WebDriver

Browser driver (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc.)

SpecFlow (for BDD testing)

How to Set Up
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Ayshamohsin/seleniumCSharp-project.git
Install the necessary NuGet packages: dotnet restore
Run the tests: dotnet test
Ensure all browser drivers are set up and the corresponding paths are configured in the project.
